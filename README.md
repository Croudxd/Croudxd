## Hi there 👋

Currently working on [env](https://github.com/Croudxd/env)

### Studying computer science at University of Reading.

Have a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Croudxd/dotfiles) and [homelab](https://github.com/Croudxd/homelab) for something different.

I spend alot of time in [cpp-lab](https://github.com/Croudxd?tab=repositories) playing around with the language such as rewriting the STL.
